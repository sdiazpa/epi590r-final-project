**Welcome to my Final Project for EPI 590r - R Bootcamp.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For my final project, I chose a dataset from tidyRainbow Datasets. It contains information about LGBTQ+ movies and their popularity. My goal is to find out what language is most common among LGBTQ+ movies!

Within my Github, you will find multiple folders that include necessary components for achieving the same outputs as I did. In particular, I will include the uses of certain items below for ease of replication.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Items to note:

-   Scripts (folder) -
    1.  There are three scripts that were written to create various items seen in the Quarto document.
    2.  For replication purposes, the 'clean_data' script isn't necessary to run, but please look at it to see how I made decisions regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria and overall cleaning. For ease, I copied and pasted my final data upload code to each other script at the top.
    3.  **I recommend running both, Descriptive_stats & Regression_models, BEFORE rendering the Quarto document under 'Documents'.**
-   Documents
    -   Here you will find the quarto documents.
    -   As a repeat: **I recommend running both, Descriptive_stats & Regression_models, BEFORE rendering the Quarto document under 'Documents'.**
-   Data
    -   Here you will find both my raw and clean data sets! Remember, I have copied and pasted the necessary code to create the clean data set at the top of 2/3 scripts (the clean_data script is my exploratory run through and fixing of things)
-   Results
    -   Here you will find copies of any items I wanted to maintain from coding. For example, I specified in my scripts to save a pdf copy of Figure 1 here.
